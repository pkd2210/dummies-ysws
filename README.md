<!-- # sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

# Dummies YSWS

## What is this?

The dummies YSWS is a YSWS (You Ship We Ship) conceptualised by [@peleg2210](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U091DE0M4NB).  
The aim of this YSWS is for you to learn a new language and ship a project with it.  
In return for doing this, we will ship you any book you want from [dummies.com](https://www.dummies.com/)(or other informational book!)

## How do I participate?
To participate, join the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) and head to the [#dummies](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C096M3EV67M) channel.  

### What do you need to do?
You need to learn a new language and make a project with it!  
You should have **never, ever** used this language before, or at least had negligible experience with it.  

## The reward!
The reward depends on your hours.
- 4 hours for $20 grant
- Anything above (till 10hrs) adds $5, e.g. 5hrs = $25
